## DESCRIPTION:
###
Developed a hybrid machine learning model to detect fake product reviews by combining TF-IDF based text classification with behavioral analysis features such as review length, capitalization, and word diversity. The system uses an SVM classifier for textual understanding and a Random Forest model for behavioral patterns, achieving an accuracy of ~78–80%
